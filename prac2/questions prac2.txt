# Logic Exercise

W and B socks
1st attempt => W or B
Let us assume that the 1st attempt sock is W. 
Now we have 1W.
2nd attempt => 1W 1B or 2W
If 2W, we have a pair of socks. 
If 1W 1B,
3rd attempt => 2W 1B or 1W 2B
In both cased, now we have a pair of same coloured socks.

Hence, the answer is 3.
