Pseudocode:
----------------------------------------
    get your score
    get opponent score
    if your score > opponent score
        print you won.
    elif opponent score > your score
        print you lost.
    else
        print it is a draw.
----------------------------------------
Justification of decision pattern:
The if-elif-else decision pattern was used because there are 3 mutually exclusive cases of winning, losing, and draw.
